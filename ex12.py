# same thing but using input to print as well which is easier and smaller and precise maybe...

name = input("Enter your name ")
age = input("Enter your age ")
height = input("Enter your height ")
weight = input("Enter your weight ")
print(
    f"Your name is {name} age is {age}, weight is {weight} and height is {height}")
